                        <span class="inline-red">ULTRADUNGEON</span> is a top-down 2D indie game that has been in development since early 2023.
                        It combines gameplay mechanics from a variety of genres, including bullet-hell, roguelike, dungeon-crawler, extraction fighter, and RPG. 
                        Players will take what loot they have accumulated, and risk it by delving into increasingly challenging dungeons. 
                        Death in these dungeons will cause you to <span class="inline-red">permanently lose</span> whatever gear you brought with you.

                        <span class="inline-red">ULTRADUNGEON</span> was initially planned to be developed using the Unity engine, 
                        however shortly after the project's inception, the decision was made to switch to the open-source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot engine.</a>  
                        Today, the project is built with Godot 4.3 and C<i>#</i>.</span>
